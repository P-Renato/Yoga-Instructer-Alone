                <p className="innerText">Hi, I’m Carolina Rose, a certified yoga teacher passionate about creating a space where everyone feels welcome—regardless of age,
                ability, or experience. My approach to yoga is rooted in radical self-acceptance, mindful movement, and deep listening to the body.
                I believe that yoga is not about perfect poses but about paying attention—attention to breath, sensation, and the present moment.
                My classes invite you to move with intention, rest when needed, and honor your body just as it is today.
                Whether you're a complete beginner, an experienced yogi, or someone working with limited mobility, you're welcome here. 
                My teaching style is gentle, inclusive, and heart-centered, designed to meet you where you are.
                I currently teach in Berlin and online. Come as you are—there is space for you.
